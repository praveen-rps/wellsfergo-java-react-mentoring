The LEVEL pseudo column returns 1 for root row,
2 for a child of a root and so on.

1. Child - > any non root node

2. Root - > Highest node within an inverted tree.

3. Parent - > Any node/row that has children.

4. Leaf - > any node without children.

5. To establish the hierarchical relationship with LEVEL we need
	START WITH CLAUSE		
	CONNECT BY CLAUSE.

Select Nth highest value from table
-----------------------------------

Syntax
------
     select level,max(colname) from tablename
     where  level = &levelno
     connect by prior colname >colname
     group by level

sql> select level, max(sal) from emp
     where level =&level 
     connect by prior sal>sal
     group by sal;


Select Nth Lowest value from table
----------------------------------

syntax
------
     select level,min(colname) from tablename
     where  level = &levelno
     connect by prior colname < colname
     group by level


sql> select level, min(sal) from emp
