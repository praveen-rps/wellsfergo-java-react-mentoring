OLAP Features in ORACLE
-----------------------

Some Features for query procesing in Oracle include the use of ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING
(OLAP) upon the database.

OLAP features are useful for DataWarehousing and Data Mart Applications.

The OLAP Operations are performance enhancements.
	TOP-N-Queries.
	GROUP BY
	CUBE
	ROLLUP

Rollup Option
-------------

1. It is used with group by cluase to display the summarized data.

2. Rollup grouping produces a results set containing the regular grouped rows
   and the subtotal values.

3. ROLLUP grouping produces subtotal and Grant Total.

4. The totalling is based on a one dimensional data hierarchy of grouped information.

Syntax
-------

GROUP BY <columnname> with ROLLUP;

Examples
--------

sql> Select Deptno, sum(sal) from emp group by deptno with rollup;

sql> select job, sum(sal) from emp group by job with rollup;

sql> select deptno, avg(sal) from emp group by deptno with rollup;


Passing Multiple columns to Rollup
----------------------------------

When multiple column are passed to ROLLUP, the ROLLUP, Groups the rows into blocks
with the same column values.

sql> select deptno, job, sum(sal) from emp group by rollup(deptno,job);

sql> select job,deptno, sum(sal) totsal from emp group by rollup(job,deptno);

sql> select job, deptno, avg(sal) totsal from emp group by rollup(job,deptno);


NULL values in the output of ROLLUP operations typically mean that the row contains
subtotal or Grant total information.

Use NVL() function for proper meaning.

CUBE operation
--------------

CUBE operation procedures a results set containg the rows from ROLLUP and cross-
tabulation views.

It is extension similar to rollup

The result of the cube is a summary that shows subtotal for every comibiation of
columns or expressions in the group by clause.

sql> select deptno, job, sum(sal) from emp group by cube(deptno,job);

sql> select job,deptno, sum(sal) from emp group b cube(job,deptno);


GROUPPING() FUNCTION
--------------------
-> The Groupping() function accepts a column and returns 0 or 1.

-> Goupping() function returns 1 when the column value is NULL, and returns 0
   when the column value is not null.

-> Grouping() function is useful when we want to display a value when a NULL would
   otherwise be returned in OLAP queries.

-> Grouping() function is used only upon queries that use ROLLUP or CUBE.

sql> select grouping(Deptno), Deptno,sum(sal) from emp group by rollup(deptno);

sql> select grouping(job),job, sum(sal) from emp group by rollup(job);

sql> select grouping(job), job, deptno, sum(sal) from emp group by cub(job,deptno);

DECODE() Function
-----------------

-> The DECODE function can be used to expand any abbreviation used in the table.

-> The function works on the same principle as the IF-THEN-ELSE.

-> We can pass a variable number of value into the call of the DECODE() function.

-> The first item is may be column name or value that need to decoded.

-> The function has no restriction on the INPUT and OUTPUT data type.

-> The function can work for only an analysis that considersan equality operator in the
   logical comparision.

syntax:
-------

sql> SELECT DECODE(<columnname/value, <coded value>, <decoded val>,....); from <tablename>;

sql> select Decode(deptno, 10,'Accounting',
                   20,'Research',
		   30,'SALES',
	           40,'Operations',
	           'Other') Departments from emp;
