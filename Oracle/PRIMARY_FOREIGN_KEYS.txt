SQL Constraints:
----------------
Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table. 
These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.

Constraints could be column level or table level. 

Column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas
table level constraints are applied to the whole table.


Following are commonly used constraints available in SQL:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.

2. DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

3. UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are different.

4. PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table.

5. FOREIGN Key: Uniquely identified a rows/records in any another database table.

6. CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

7. INDEX: Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.



NOT NULL Constraint:
--------------------

By default, a column can hold NULL values. 

If you do not want a column to have a NULL value, then you need to
define such constraint on this column specifying that NULL is now not allowed for that column.

A NULL is not the same as no data, rather, it represents unknown data.

Eg.

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
 ID INT NOT NULL,
 NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
 AGE INT NOT NULL,
 ADDRESS CHAR (25) ,
 SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
 PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);



If CUSTOMERS table has already been created, then to add a NOT NULL constraint to SALARY column in Oracle
and MySQL, you would write a statement similar to the following:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 MODIFY SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2) NOT NULL;



DEFAULT Constraint:
--------------------
The DEFAULT constraint provides a default value to a column when the INSERT INTO statement does not provide
a specific value.

Eg.

For example, the following SQL creates a new table called CUSTOMERS and adds five columns. Here, SALARY
column is set to 5000.00 by default, so in case INSERT INTO statement does not provide a value for this column.
then by default this column would be set to 5000.00.


CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
 ID INT NOT NULL,
 NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
 AGE INT NOT NULL,
 ADDRESS CHAR (25) ,
 SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2) DEFAULT 5000.00,
 PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


If CUSTOMERS table has already been created, then to add a DFAULT constraint to SALARY column, you would
write a statement similar to the following:


ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 MODIFY SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2) DEFAULT 5000.00;

Drop Default Constraint:
------------------------

To drop a DEFAULT constraint, use the following SQL:


ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 ALTER COLUMN SALARY DROP DEFAULT;




UNIQUE Constraint:
------------------
The UNIQUE Constraint prevents two records from having identical values in a particular column. 
In the CUSTOMERS table, for example, you might want to prevent two or more people from having identical age.

eg.

The following SQL creates a new table called CUSTOMERS and adds five columns. Here, AGE
column is set to UNIQUE, so that you can not have two records with same age:


CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
 ID INT NOT NULL,
 NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
 AGE INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 ADDRESS CHAR (25) ,
 SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
 PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);



If CUSTOMERS table has already been created, then to add a UNIQUE constraint to AGE column, you would write
a statement similar to the following:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 MODIFY AGE INT NOT NULL UNIQUE;


You can also use following syntax, which supports naming the constraint in multiple columns as well:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 ADD CONSTRAINT myUniqueConstraint UNIQUE(AGE, SALARY);
 DROP a UNIQUE Constraint:


To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
 DROP CONSTRAINT myUniqueConstraint;



To create primary key
----------------------

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
       ID   INT              NOT NULL,
       NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
       AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
       ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
       SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
       PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


To add a primary key to an existing table
-----------------------------------------
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);



To create a primary key on multiplie keys
------------------------------------------
REATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
       ID   INT              NOT NULL,
       NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
       AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
       ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
       SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),        
       PRIMARY KEY (ID, NAME)
);



to add to an existing table
---------------------------

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS 
   ADD CONSTRAINT PK_CUSTID PRIMARY KEY (ID, NAME);


To Delete primary key
---------------------

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS DROP PRIMARY KEY ;


To Create a foreign key
-----------------------

CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
	ID INT NOT NULL,
	PNAME VARCHAR2(10),
	PDATE DATE,
	FOREIGN KEY(ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(ID)
);


To add a foreign key to existing table
--------------------------------------

ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD FOREIGN KEY(ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(ID);

To add a foreign key with constraint name
------------------------------------------

ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY(ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(ID)


TO Delete foreign key
---------------------

ALTER TABLE ORDERS DROP CONSTRAINT FK_CONSTRAINT;
