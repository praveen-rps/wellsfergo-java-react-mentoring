ROWID Pseudo Column
-------------------

ROWID  is an exact physical address of a row.

ROWID is used by oracle to locate any row.

The Rowid value is assign by oracle itself.

rowid are unique identifies for a row in a table.

when a row is deleted, oracle may reassign its rowid to a new row that is inserted.

the rowid can never be inserted, update and deleted manually.

the rowid pseudo column can be used in select and where clauses.


sql> select rowid, empno, ename from emp;

sql> select max(rowid) from emp;

sql> select * from emp where rowid='AABN8CAAHAAAVPCAAD';

sql> select * from emp p
     where rowid < (select max(rowid) from emp s where p.ename=s.ename);


sql> delete from emp p
     where rowid <(select max(rowid) from emp s where p.ename=s.ename);

sql> select * from stu where rowid not in(select min(rowid) from stu group by s_id);

sql> select * from stu where rowid not in (select min(rowid) from stu group by s_id);

sql> select empno, ename from emp where (rowid,1) in (select rowid, mod(rownum,2) from emp);

sql> select rownum,ename from emp group by rownum, ename having mod(rownum,2)=0;

sql> select B.sal, sum(a.sal) from emp A, emp B
     where A.rowid < B.rowid
     group by B.Rowid, B.sal;

sql> select B.ename, B.job, B.sal, sum(A.sal) "Cum Sal"
     from emp A, emp B
     where A.rowid < = B.rowid
     group by B.rowid, B.sal, B.ename, B.job;
