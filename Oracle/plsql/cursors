A cursor is a pointer to this context area. PL/SQL controls the context area through a cursor.

 A cursor holds the rows (one or more) returned by a SQL statement. 
The set of rows the cursor holds is referred to as the active set.

You can name a cursor so that it could be referred to in a program to fetch and process the rows returned by the SQL statement, 
one at a time. There are two types of cursors −

Implicit cursors
Explicit cursors


Implicit Cursors
----------------
Implicit cursors are automatically created by Oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed, when there is no explicit cursor for the statement. Programmers cannot control the implicit cursors and the information in it.

Whenever a DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) is issued, an implicit cursor is associated with this statement. 
For INSERT operations, the cursor holds the data that needs to be inserted. 
For UPDATE and DELETE operations, the cursor identifies the rows that would be affected.


In PL/SQL, you can refer to the most recent implicit cursor as the SQL cursor, which always has attributes such as %FOUND, %ISOPEN, %NOTFOUND, and %ROWCOUNT.

The SQL cursor has additional attributes, %BULK_ROWCOUNT and %BULK_EXCEPTIONS, designed for use with the FORALL statement. 
The following table provides the description of the most used attributes −


Attribute & Description
-----------------------
	
%FOUND   Returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement affected one or more rows or a SELECT INTO statement returned one or more rows. 	 Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

%NOTFOUND  The logical opposite of %FOUND. It returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement affected no rows, or a SELECT INTO statement 		   returned no rows. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.


%ISOPEN  Always returns FALSE for implicit cursors, because Oracle closes the SQL cursor automatically after executing its associated SQL 		 statement.

%ROWCOUNT  Returns the number of rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or returned by a SELECT INTO statement.


DECLARE  
   total_rows number(2); 
BEGIN 
   UPDATE customers 
   SET salary = salary + 500; 
   IF sql%notfound THEN 
      dbms_output.put_line('no customers selected'); 
   ELSIF sql%found THEN 
      total_rows := sql%rowcount;
      dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' customers selected '); 
   END IF;  
END; 
/ 





Explicit Cursors
-----------------
Explicit cursors are programmer-defined cursors for gaining more control over the context area. 
An explicit cursor should be defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL Block. 
It is created on a SELECT Statement which returns more than one row.

The syntax for creating an explicit cursor is −
------------------------------------------------
CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement; 


Working with an explicit cursor includes the following steps 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Declaring the cursor for initializing the memory

2. Opening the cursor for allocating the memory

3. Fetching the cursor for retrieving the data

4. Closing the cursor to release the allocated memory

5. Declaring the Cursor

6. Declaring the cursor defines the cursor with a name and the associated SELECT statement. For example −

CURSOR c_customers IS 
   SELECT id, name, address FROM customers; 


Opening the Cursor
------------------
Opening the cursor allocates the memory for the cursor and makes it ready for fetching the rows returned by the SQL statement into it. 

For example, we will open the above defined cursor as follows −
---------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN c_customers; 
Fetching the Cursor
Fetching the cursor involves accessing one row at a time. 

For example, we will fetch rows from the above-opened cursor as follows −
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FETCH c_customers INTO c_id, c_name, c_addr; 
Closing the Cursor
Closing the cursor means releasing the allocated memory. For example, we will close the above-opened cursor as follows −

CLOSE c_customers;

DECLARE 
   c_id customers.id%type; 
   c_name customerS.No.ame%type; 
   c_addr customers.address%type; 
   CURSOR c_customers is 
      SELECT id, name, address FROM customers; 
BEGIN 
   OPEN c_customers; 
   LOOP 
   FETCH c_customers into c_id, c_name, c_addr; 
      EXIT WHEN c_customers%notfound; 
      dbms_output.put_line(c_id || ' ' || c_name || ' ' || c_addr); 
   END LOOP; 
   CLOSE c_customers; 
END;

9>   LOOP

11>     EXIT WHEN emp_cur%NOTFOUND;

13>     || ' ' ||emp_cur.salary); 
14>  END LOOP; 
15>  END;

3>  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM emp_tbl; 
4>  emp_rec emp_cur%rowtype; 
5> BEGIN 
6>  FOR emp_rec in sales_cur 
7>  LOOP  
8>  dbms_output.put_line(emp_cur.first_name || ' ' ||emp_cur.last_name 
9>    || ' ' ||emp_cur.salary);  
10> END LOOP;
